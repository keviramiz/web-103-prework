## Notes

One additional challenge was determining the most effective component structure. I initially rendered creator cards directly within the main page, but as the UI and interactions grew, this became difficult to maintain. Refactoring each creator card into its own component required rethinking state flow and props, but ultimately improved reusability and clarity.

*It is noted that Generative AI tools were used as assistance in creation of this application.*
